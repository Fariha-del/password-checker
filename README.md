# Password Strength Checker

This is a simple Python project that checks the strength of a password entered by the user and gives suggestions to improve it.

## How it Works
- You enter a password.
- The program checks if the password:
  - Has at least 8 characters.
  - Includes lowercase and uppercase letters.
  - Contains numbers.

- Based on this, it labels your password as **Strong**, **Medium**, or **Weak**.

If your password is not strong, it gives clear tips on how to make it better.
